## New whitepaper to help people work better

AWS Well-Architected Framework

## The Cloud Removes Constraints

## Build Applications the way we always wanted

## Six Laws Every Cloud Architecture Should Know

### 1. Lucas Critique
"It is naive to try to predict the effects of a change entirely on the bassis of relationships observed in historical data"

* Past Data
* Realtime analytics
* Machine Learning for future predictions

Real-Time STreaming Data with Amazon Kinesis Streams
* ubisoft
* sonos
* mlbam 
* mediamath
* hearst
* Adroll
* acquia
* coinbase: 1 billion transactions per day

#### Streaming Data Processing is Still Challenging

Announcing Kinesis Analytics: 3 steps to analytics
```
Kinesis analytics -> Kinesis Firehose -> Redshift -> Quicksight
```

### 2. Gall's law
complex systems evolv from simple systems, not made from scratch. 

Right now you can build from: 

####  VMs
  * New VMs. 
#### Containers
* many customers using: Expedia, Coursera (batch processing)
* Still lots of undifferentiating heavy lifting.   
* Announces EC2 Container Registry 
* AZ Aware Service Scheduler
* Docker integration with compose
* ECS CLI

```
ecs-cli up
ecs-cli compose up
```                        

#### Lambda
No server is easier to manage than no server

##### New Features since Lambda was rolled out
* Cloud Formation Support
* Integration with SNS, SWF, ASK
* API Gateway Integration
* Java
* Mobile SDK and Cognito Integration

Today, 4 more features announced. 

### 3. Law of Demeter

Each unit should have only limited knowledge of its own domain. 
How can we simplify the development of the next generation of mobile apps? 


### 4. Occam's razor
the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected

Book: [The Forth Paradigm](http://www.amazon.com/The-Fourth-Paradigm-Data-Intensive-Scientific/dp/0982544200)

Lot's more talk about analytics and doing things with data that has
been collected.  This is for prediction. 

More applications doing prediction analysis with location.

Werner talks about all the new style applications that are more connected with sensors and devices. 

Sports data is more and more important.  

Lot of heavy lifting with IoT.  Devices, network, security, data collection, smarts.  

AWS IoT:
* Gives you an SDK to put on the devices. 
* X509 certifications generated by AWS or bring your own. 
* Already have DynamoDB, Kinesis, and S3 to collect
* Smarts for Trigger Lambda Functions

What about when devices are offline? 
* AWS IoT Device Shadows (Read the last reported state, or set the future state via restful API)

### 5. I missed this one :-(

### 6. THe Gestalt Principle
The whole is greater than the sum of the parts.              

AWS has a lot of partners to help people be productive in IoT

### 7.  You've got to fight for your right to party
Announces some artist that will be performing that I've never heard of. 

## Guest Speakers

### Jason Fischl, VP of engineering, Remind
Mission is to connect every teacher, student, and parent in the world.  

Very seasonal with 'Back to School'.  Every August, usage is higher than ever been. 

[Empire Development Platform](https://github.com/remind101/empire)

Provides a Heroku like platform that sits on top of Containers. 

### Deiter May , SVP Digital Business Models at BMW

Brand new luxery car BMW 7 Series

* 116,324 employees
* 30 production and assembly plants in 14 countries
* 2.118 mi vehicles sold in 2014
* 80.4 bn euro revenue in 2014

Despite these successes, there are lots of disruption coming. 

* Integration of Car as powerful IoT device
* Automatic driving cars
* Mobility services spreading across the world
* Less differentiation through hardware and more through digital

Carasso (Car as a service) collects data from drivers and updates maps. 

### Dr. Matt Wood, GM Product Strategy , AWS

Wear's an autobot T-shirt
IoT adds a Device Gateway.  MQTT is an old protocol, but highly connected low latency devices. 

The device gateway is attached to a rules engine that can be configured in the AWS console. 

Robot demo with sensor was super cool! 

### Patrick Pinkston, VP Information Solutions John Deere
Advanced products and service and is committed to the succes of those linked to the land. 

### Diana Briant manager of Data Center at Intel

When things are easy to use, innovation happens. 

X1 instance is an Intel Xeon E7 V3.  100 virtual cores. 

* Talks about working with the Michael J Fox Foundation for Parkinson's research. 
* FarmLogs ability to double the production of food by 2050.
